    <h1>Sophie's Pitching Lessons</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Sophie and I am a former Division I softball pitcher.  I have coached at both the Division I and Division II level, and love the game of softball.  With pitching being my specialty I really wanted to continue coaching with Private lessons.  Helping these young women learn something new and have the want to grow and compete in the game is my favorite part of coaching.</p>
